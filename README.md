# Why Twitter?

**Add intention to your scrolling.**

Why Twitter? is a simple Chrome extension designed to break the cycle of mindless scrolling. Instead of immediately loading your feed, it pauses the experience and asks one simple question: *"Why are you here?"*

By requiring you to type out your intention, it adds just enough friction to turn an impulsive click into a conscious choice.

## Features

- **Intentional Browsing:** Blocks Twitter/X by default until you state your purpose.
- **Time-Boxed Access:** Grants 5 minutes of access per tab after you enter a reason.
- **Privacy-First:** All data (including your reasons) is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers.
- **Seamless Design:** Clean UI that feels like a native part of the platform.
